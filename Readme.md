## Intent

This small repo is meant for me to continue learning Java.  
I have chosen a basic video from FreeCodeCamp even though much of this material I already know.

The video can be found here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-java-programming/

I am using the intellij IDE for this project:
